			<h2>Most asked question...What is the clothing industry?</h2>
			<p>The clothing industry, also known as the apparel industry, garment industry, or the fashion industry, began centuries ago in homes around the world. Today, the ready-to-wear clothing industry is a thriving industry that reaches males, females, and people of all ages with garments for all purposes, from the purely practical all the way to haute couture. The clothing industry is fraught with constant competition and largely ruled by ever changing fashion trends.</p>
			<br>
			<p>There was once a time when all stages of making a piece of clothing were done in the home. From the sheering of the sheep to provide wool to the spinning of that same wool to create yarn and thread, which was then crafted into a ruffly hewn garment, all these steps were done by hand. The 1830s in America largely marked the end of the home-spun garment.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Men's clothing, tailored and custom made, marked the first garments in the initial fledgling years of the clothing industry. This then translated into the first foray into ready-to-wear clothing for men. At this time, women were still fashioning their own clothing items.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Within the clothing industry, the United States is the largest importer of clothing and garments. Roughly 97 percent of all clothing purchased within the United States is made outside the country. At least some part of this percentage of garments is created in China, the Philippines, and India.</p>
